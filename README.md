this Graph shows the weekday that our rental bikes are used the most based on two criteria, there gender, and wether or not they are a normal customer or if theyre a subscriber. based on the results it seems as if Male subscribers use our bikes the most compared to any other demographic.

this graph shows where the ending location of our bikes are after they are rented. it seems that most of our customers bike trips end at the bottom of Manhattan as well

## Summary
based on the graphs there are multiple trends. the first trend is it seems that the company has a strong usage rate when it comes to male customers and that it has to focus on increasing the usage rate with the female gender. another outcome that can be taken from the graphs is that Most bikes are rented/checked out in Manhattan, used for only five minutes, and is usually used on weekdays at 8am or 5pm-6pm. two visualizations that I would like to see be made is one, have a visualization of where most female customers start there bike rental because maybe more bikes in that location can lead to more female customers. the second visualization would be to see the trip duration between customers and subscribers to see if subscribers actually use the bikes longer than customers
